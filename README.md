## Azerothcore Lua Demon Morpher Module

This module lets Warlocks kill demons and claim their models to apply on their own summoned demons.

Make your Felguard a Wrathguard, your Felhunter a Hellboar, and much, much more!

This module requires an item ID to open the morph menu. The Lua script will create the required character database table, item, and vendor for you, if you toggle the variable to do so.

This isn't a finished product, it is missing some performance optimizations but works perfectly fine out of the box.
